# WeatherPy and VacationPy Project

## Overview
This project utilizes Python to analyze weather data from cities worldwide, visualize relationships between weather variables and latitude, and identify ideal vacation spots based on weather conditions. It consists of two main parts:

### WeatherPy
- Analyzing weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API to create visualizations of weather conditions relative to latitude.

### VacationPy
- Using weather data to identify optimal vacation destinations based on user-defined criteria and visualizing these spots on a map using Geoapify.

## Instructions
### WeatherPy
1. Open and execute WeatherPy.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the instructions within the notebook to fetch weather data, generate plots, and analyze relationships between weather variables and latitude.

### VacationPy
1. Open and execute VacationPy.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Utilize weather data generated from WeatherPy to filter cities based on vacation criteria.
3. Visualize ideal vacation spots on a map using Geoapify.
